# weather-app

Welcome to my new project! This is [another practice from The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-weather-app). There are only a few requirements for this practice, just let the user input a location and fetch the weather forecast from an API and display any useful data from it on the page in no specific way.

On my previous practice, a [ToDo List](https://github.com/HectorVilas/todo-list), I did everything wrong. No problem solving, no planning, and got carried away and forgot to respect the SOLID principles. This time I want to prepare before writing a single line of code, so I'll be using this README.md as rubberducking while documenting a little my progress.

For this project I'm going to use Webpack again. I've been setting everything up, with live server so the development goes smooth. I'm still having trouble setting things up with Webpack, but I think I'm getting a better grasp of it, I like it.

## requisites
-  a way to search for a specific location
- allow Fahrenheit/Celsius toggle
- change the look of the page based on the data (by changing colors or by adding images that describe the weather)
- Write the functions that hit the API. You’re going to want functions that can take a location and return the weather data for that location. For now, just console.log() the information.
- write the functions that process the JSON data you’re getting from the API and return an object with only the data you require for your app
- set up a simple form that will let users input their location and will fetch the weather info
- display the information on your webpage
- optional: add a "loading" component that displays from the time the form is submitted until the information comes back from the API
